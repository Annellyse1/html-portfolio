<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I pushed until i pushed him away,made his life nearly miserable with my words and actions. I loved him
  how i thought he should be loved even when it was wasnt how he should have or wanted to be loved. Now 
  i fear that i may have lost him. I messed up bigtime for the last 3 years and now im fighting to win him back. 
  I gave him unnecessary scars and it's eating me up for the last 3 months since he broke up with me.
  
  He's willing to give me another chance and i really hope he does. I miss him and i see how i terrible i was now. 
  It took too long, way too long and now im in limbo waiting for him rediscover himself after i did this to him and want
  him to love me again. I'm about to cry but i did this to myself. I had a good man, and didnt always appreciate 
  or treat him well. The heartbreak is tremendous. Cant eat, sleep or think properlyand i just go over the times i
  should have been more grateful and appreciative. Ive been dealing with this on my own. I don't have anyone i confide in 
  and just walk around keeping up with appearances. Smiling when all i wanna do is crash in his arms. 
  The only person i wanna talk too and spend my time with
  part of the problem really. I gave him no space and made my life revolve around his.Too much tv thing really
